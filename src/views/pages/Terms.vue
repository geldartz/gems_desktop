                <p class="my-5">
                    GEMS Time and Attendance Management System is an application which provides its users a variety of
                    services, which may include, but not limited to the following:
                    <br />
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-8">
                    <li><b>Time Tracking</b> -
                        GEMS allows employees to clock in and out on their mobile devices. Time entries are recorded and
                        stored securely in the cloud.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Real-time Attendance Monitoring</b> -
                        Keep track of employee attendance and whereabouts in real-time with the attendance monitoring
                        feature. Immediate heads can easily view the attendance status of their employees.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Customizable Shift Scheduling</b> -
                        Create and manage employee work shifts effortlessly. Customize shifts based on employee
                        availability, workload, and business requirements. Employees can view their shifts and update
                        them when needed.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Geolocation</b> -
                        Ensure accuracy by enabling geolocation features. GEMS identifies the clock-ins and outs at
                        specific locations and notifies the employee if the location is beyond the required proximity.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Transaction Management</b> -
                        Simplify employee requests and approvals with GEMS. Employees can make employee requests, such
                        as overtime and leaves, directly through the app, and supervisors can review and approve them
                        with ease.

                <ol class="list-decimal ml-8">
                    <li>Clock-in or Clock-out and Time Entries -
                        Time Tracking starts when a user clocks-in and ends upon clock-out. The user should ensure
                        successful clock-in and clock-out to generate time entries in the app.
                    </li>
                    <li>Online Use of Application -
                        The use of the application requires a connection to the internet as it is cloud-based.
